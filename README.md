# MMM
a mystery adventure involving MCP

## üïµÔ∏è Main Story:"Murder at Ch√¢teau de Verre"
In the misty hills of Provence, the grand Ch√¢teau de Verre stands as a relic of aristocratic opulence. It‚Äôs 1923, and the mansion hosts a lavish soir√©e to celebrate the return of famed explorer Lucien Moreau, who has just returned from a perilous expedition in Egypt. But as the clock strikes midnight, Lucien is found dead in his study‚Äîpoisoned wine in hand, a cryptic note beside him:‚ÄúThe past always returns.‚Äù

The guests are trapped in the mansion due to a storm. You, the player, take on the role of an investigator connected to the MCP Server. Your mission: collect clues (resources), ask the right questions (prompt templates), and take decisive actions to uncover the murderer before dawn.

## üß† Game Mechanics (TypeScript + MCP Server)
Clue Collection: Use MCP to fetch resources (e.g., diary entries, letters, fingerprints).

### Prompt Templates: Ask questions like:

```python
ask_character("√âloise Moreau", "Where were you at midnight?");
ask_Character("Henri Duval", "Do you recognize this poison?");
```

### Actions:

```python
take_action("Search Study");
take_action("Analyze Wine Glass");
take_action("Confront Madeleine Rousseau");
```

MCP Context Protocol: Each clue updates the context window. You must manage context size and relevance to avoid losing critical information.
